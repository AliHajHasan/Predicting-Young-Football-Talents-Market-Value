# Predicting-Young-Football-Talents-Market-Value
This repo presents a predictive framework
for estimating the market value of young football players by
utilizing multi-source performance statistics, engineered features,
and machine learning techniques. The work is motivated by
the growing importance of data-driven approaches in football
recruitment, particularly for scouting and player valuation. The
paper begins with an introduction to the topic and the motivations
behind the study, followed by a review of related work in
football analytics, with a focus on recent advances in player
valuation and prediction. A custom dataset is then introduced
and analyzed, along with the engineered features used in the
models. Several supervised machine learning models are applied
to different target formulations to identify the most accurate
predictive approach. The results are presented and discussed,
with emphasis on the most influential features driving model
performance. The paper concludes with a summary of findings
and suggestions for future research directions. All source code
and datasets used in this study are publicly available (reference
to be added).
